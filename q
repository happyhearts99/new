like javascript/reactjs/typescript. It is object oriented and organizable and easier to set up in the beginning, also it 
can always extend to more libraries, components. I also like the original concept that reactjs from server rendering
compares the virtual dom and check to see where it gets updated
and only updates that portion. Javascript is easier to debug by setting up break points
and can track on the browser developer tools. Typescript specify data type and can also make function support function overloading. 
Dislike: c++ more complicated and strict rules. C++ can't support garbage collection and more difficult to debug.
